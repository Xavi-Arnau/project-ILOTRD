# Introduction to the Internet Lord Of the Rings Database (ILOTRD)

Hello! This is a project made with academic purposes using html,
javascript, the boostrap framework and a public API as the source
of data.

I tried my best to make a cool application using the data the API
returns.

## About The One API

[The One API](https://the-one-api.dev/) is a project made and kept
by [Rike](https://rike.dev/). It returns plenty of cool stuff about
characters, quotes, the books, the movies, etc.
